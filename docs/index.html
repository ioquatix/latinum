	<h1>Latinum</h1><main><p>Latinum is a library for resource and money calculations. It provides immutable <a href="source/Latinum/Resource/index.html" title="Latinum::Resource"><code class="language-ruby">class Latinum::Resource</code></a> objects for dealing with quantities of named resources with an arbitrary number of decimal places, and <a href="source/Latinum/Bank/index.html" title="Latinum::Bank"><code class="language-ruby">class Latinum::Bank</code></a> objects for converting resources and formatting them for output. Latinum doesn't include any global state by design and thus is ideal for integration with other frameworks/libraries.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I was originally planning on using the <a href="https://github.com/RubyMoney/money">Money gem</a>, but it's <a href="https://github.com/RubyMoney/money/blob/39b617cca8f02c885cc8246e0aab3e9dc5f90e15/lib/money/currency.rb#L19-L21">dependency on global state</a> makes it hard to use if you want to deal with money as an immutable value type.</p>
<p>Additionally, I wanted to support BitCoin, Japanese Yen, etc. The money gem was heavily biased towards decimal currency. It had (~2012) <a href="https://github.com/RubyMoney/money/issues/197">fields like <code>dollars</code> and <code>cents</code></a> which don't really make sense and don't really align with the real world. These days they have fixed parts of the API, but it's a bit of a mess now, supporting both decimal and non-decimal values.</p>
<p>Another problem I had at the time was the <a href="https://github.com/RubyMoney/money/issues/195">concept of zero</a>. It should be possible to have an additive (e.g. 0) and multiplicative identity (e.g. 1) do the right thing. In fact, in Latinum, you can multiply <code>Latinum::Resource</code> instances by a scalar and get a useful result (e.g. for computing discounts).</p>
<p>Finally, because of the above problem, it was not obvious at the time how to sum up a collection of money instances correctly. In fact, this is still a problem and a separate gem, based on the <code>Latinum::Collection</code> concept, <a href="https://github.com/lulalala/money-collection">was made</a>. However, this all fits together in a rather haphazard way.</p>
<p>Latinum addresses all these issues. It has an immutable value type <code>Latinum::Resource</code> which has a robust definition: A value (e.g. 5.0025) and a resource name (USD). The semantics of resources are well defined without the need for &quot;Currency&quot; state like the symbol, how many decimal places, etc. So, it suits well for serialization into a database, and for formatting to the user, there is <code>Latinum::Bank</code> which gives you the choice of how you decide to format things or exchange them, whether you want to round something off, etc.</p>
