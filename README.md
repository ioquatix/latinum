# Latinum

Latinum is a library for resource and currency calculations. It provides immutable `Resource` objects for dealing with quantities of named resources with an arbitrary number of decimal places, and `Bank` objects for converting resources and formatting them for output. Latinum doesn't include any global state by default and thus is ideal for integration with other frameworks/libraries.

## Motivation

I was originally planning on using the [Money gem](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money), but it's [dependency on global state](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money/blob/39b617cca8f02c885cc8246e0aab3e9dc5f90e15/lib/money/currency.rb#L19-L21) makes it hard to use if you want to deal with money as an immutable value type.

Additionally, I wanted to support BitCoin, Japanese Yen, etc. The money gem was heavily biased towards decimal currency. It had (~2012) [fields like `dollars` and `cents`](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money/issues/197) which don't really make sense and don't really align with the real world. These days they have fixed parts of the API, but it's a bit of a mess now, supporting both decimal and non-decimal values.

Another problem I had at the time was the [concept of zero](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money/issues/195). It should be possible to have an additive (e.g. 0) and multiplicative identity (e.g. 1) do the right thing. In fact, in Latinum, you can multiply `Latinum::Resource` instances by a scalar and get a useful result (e.g. for computing discounts).

Finally, because of the above problem, it was not obvious at the time how to sum up a collection of money instances correctly. In fact, this is still a problem and a separate gem, based on the `Latinum::Collection` concept, [was made](https://github.com/lulalala/money-collection). However, this all fits together in a rather haphazard way.

Latinum addresses all these issues. It has an immutable value type `Latinum::Resource` which has a robust definition: A value (e.g. 5.0025) and a resource name (USD). The semantics of resources are well defined without the need for "Currency" state like the symbol, how many decimal places, etc. So, it suits well for serialization into a database, and for formatting to the user, there is `Latinum::Bank` which gives you the choice of how you decide to format things or exchange them, whether you want to round something off, etc.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

	gem 'latinum'

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install latinum

## Usage

Latinum has several core concepts:

- A `Resource` represents an immutable value with a specific face name (e.g. `'USD'`).
- A `Resource` can only be combined with resources with the same face name.
- A `Bank` is responsible for managing currencies and formatting options.
- A `Bank` can exchange currencies explicitly with a given set of exchange rates.
- A `Collection` is responsible for adding currencies together and is completely deterministic.

### Resources and Collections

To create a new resource, use a string for accuracy:

	> ten = Latinum::Resource.new("10.00", "NZD")
	=> 10.0 NZD
	> ten.amount == "10.00".to_d
	=> true

You can add resources of different values but with the same name:

	> ten + ten
	=> 20.0 NZD

But, you can't add resources of different names together:

	> twenty = Latinum::Resource.new("20.00", "AUD")
	=> 20.0 AUD
	> ten + twenty
	DifferentResourceNameError: Cannot operate on different currencies!

To add multiple currencies together, use a collection:

	> collection = Latinum::Collection.new
	> collection << [ten, twenty]
	> collection.collect(&:to_s)
	=> [10.0 NZD, 20.0 AUD]

#### Calculating Totals

The `Latinum::Collection` is the correct way to sum up a list of transactions or other items with an
associated `Latinum::Resource`. Here is an example:

	<table class="listing transactions" data-model="Transaction">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th class="name">Name</th>
				<th class="date">Date</th>
				<th class="price">Price</th>
				<th class="quantity">Quantity</th>
				<th class="subtotal">Sub-total</th>
				<th class="tax_rate">Tax</th>
				<th class="total">Total</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<?r 
				currencies = Set.new
				
				summary = {
					:subtotal => Latinum::Collection.new(currencies),
					:tax => Latinum::Collection.new(currencies),
					:total => Latinum::Collection.new(currencies)
				}
				
				invoice.transactions.each do |transaction|
					subtotal = transaction.subtotal
					summary[:subtotal] << subtotal
					summary[:tax] << subtotal * transaction.tax_rate.to_d
					summary[:total] << transaction.total
				
			?>
			<tr data-id="#{transaction.id}" data-rev="#{transaction.rev}">
				<th class="name">#{f.text transaction.name}</th>
				<td class="date">#{f.text transaction.date}</td>
				<td class="price">#{f.text transaction.price}</td>
				<td class="quantity">#{f.quantity transaction}</td>
				<td class="subtotal">#{f.text subtotal}</td>
				<td class="tax_rate">#{f.tax transaction}</td>
				<td class="total">#{f.text transaction.total}</td>
			</tr>
			<?r end ?>
		</tbody>
		<tfoot>
			<?r currencies.each do |currency| ?>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="5">#{currency} Summary:</td>
				<td class="subtotal">#{f.text summary[:subtotal][currency]}</td>
				<td class="tax_rate">#{f.text summary[:tax][currency]}</td>
				<td class="total">#{f.text summary[:total][currency]}</td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
			<?r end ?>
		</tfoot>
	</table>

### Banks and Exchange Rates

The bank is responsible for formatting and exchange rates:

	require 'latinum/bank'
	require 'latinum/currencies/global'
	
	> bank = Latinum::Bank.new(Latinum::Currencies::Global)
	> bank << Latinum::ExchangeRate.new("NZD", "AUD", "0.5")
	
	> nzd = Latinum::Resource.new("10", "NZD")
	=> 10.0 NZD
	> aud = bank.exchange nzd, "AUD"
	=> 5.0 AUD

Formatting an amount is typically required for presentation to the end user:

	> bank.format(nzd)
	=> "$10.00 NZD"
	
	> bank.format(aud, name: nil)
	=> "$5.00"

The bank can also be used to parse currency, which will depend on the priority of currencies if a symbol that matches multiple currencies is supplied:

	> bank.parse("$5")
	=> 5.0 USD
	
	> bank.parse("€5")
	=> 5.0 EUR

Currency codes take priority over symbols if specified:

	> bank.parse("€5 NZD")
	=> 5.0 NZD

### Conversion To and From Integers

For storage in traditional databases, you may prefer to use integers. Based on the precision of the currency, you can store integer representations:

	> resource = Latinum::Resource.new("1.12345678", "BTC")
	
	> 112345678 == bank.to_integral(resource)
	true
	
	> resource == bank.from_integral(112345678, "BTC")
	true

As BitCoin has 8 decimal places, it requires an integer representation with at least 10^8.

### ActiveRecord Serialization

Latinum can be easily used in a [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord) model simply by declaring a serialized data-type for a string or text column, e.g.

	class Transaction < ActiveRecord::Base
		serialize :total, Latinum::Resource
	end

It can be used like so:

	> transaction = Transaction.new(:total => "10 NZD")
	> transaction.total * 2
	=> "20.0 NZD"

To format the output, use a `Latinum::Bank`, e.g. assuming the bank is set up correctly:

	> bank.format(transaction.total)
	=> "$20.00 NZD"
	
	> bank.format(transaction.total, name: nil)
	=> "$20.00"
	
	> bank.format(transaction.total, symbol: nil)
	=> "20.00 NZD"

### Relaxo Serialization

Latinum is natively supported by [Relaxo](https://github.com/ioquatix/relaxo) (CouchDB) and as such can be used in [Relaxo models](https://github.com/ioquatix/relaxo-model) easily.

	require 'latinum'
	require 'relaxo/model'
	require 'relaxo/model/properties/latinum'
	
	class Transaction
		include Relaxo::Model

		property :name
		property :price, Attribute[Latinum::Resource]
	end
	
	db = Relaxo.connect('test')
	db.create!
	
	t = Transaction.create(db, price: Latinum::Resource.load("50 NZD"))
	
	t.price
	# => <Latinum::Resource "50.0 NZD">
	
	# Save and reload from database server:
	t.save
	t = Transaction.fetch(db, t.id)
	
	t.price
	# => <Latinum::Resource "50.0 NZD">

It gets stored in the database like so:

	{
		"_id": "740f4728fc9a571d826688db2f004771",
		"_rev": "1-45a29c63311cfa0d5a765707184b2b3b",
		"type": "transaction",
		"price": [
			"50.0",
			"NZD"
		]
	}
